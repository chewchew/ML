SCENE I. Verona. A public place.

    Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers 

SAMPSON

    Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.

BENVOLIO

    Part, fools!
    Put up your swords; you know not what you do.

    Beats down their swords

    Enter TYBALT

SCENE III. A room in Capulet's house.

    Enter LADY CAPULET and Nurse 

LADY CAPULET

    Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.

TYBALT

    Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
    Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
    I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall
    Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.

    Exit

ROMEO

    [To JULIET] If I profane with my unworthiest hand
    This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
    My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
    To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.

JOHAN

    What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,
    As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
    Have at thee, coward!

    They fight
    Bla bla bla
